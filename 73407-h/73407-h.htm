  <h2 class='c005'>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>The writer of these letters and maker of
these drawings went overseas with the
first Technology unit; landed in France on the
Fourth of July, 1917; began his service as
a member of the Reserve Mallet, and was
mustered into the American Army on October
1, 1917. In preparing the letters and
cartoons for the press, it was thought best
to begin where rumors of impending German
surrender first appear in the correspondence,
thus confining the humorously illustrated
story to the last weeks of the war. Mr. Day
wrote his letters with no intention or expectation
of having them published; that is entirely
the work of his friends, who believe that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>his impromptu sketches will be found to
furnish ample justification for the existence of
this book.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Day served in the Reserve Mallet, a
camion unit to whose spirit and efficiency
<i>Stars and Stripes</i> has paid the following unaffected
and authentic tribute:</p>

<p class='c008'>“In a summer when again and again the
historic phrase ‘Franco-American troops’
makes its appearance in the communiqués,
the distinction of being the complete amalgam
of the two armies belongs to the flying squadron
of emergency transportation, that trundling
troop of trucks, that charging company
of camions, the Mallet Reserve.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This organization consists of 700 five-ton
trucks—American trucks driven over French
roads, driven now by French now by American
drivers, officered by French and American
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>officers, carrying French and American troops,
French and American ammunition.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Mallet Reserve is so named because
its commanding officer is Major Mallet of the
French Cavalry, and is called a Reserve because
it is attached to no Army Corps, but
rather is held in reserve for emergency duty
whenever a crisis in the war brings a crisis in
transportation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This means that the interminable line of
camions bearing the Mallet mark will invariably
appear wherever things are hottest,
that the trucks and their drivers know no
rest from one year’s end to the other.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thus you saw them along the roads up
Cambrai way last fall. When French troops
were rushed into the gap that opened during
the German drive of March, Mallet trucks
carried them, and they were Mallet trucks
which bore northward the French soldiers who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>made their sudden and startling appearance
among the British in Flanders during the April
fighting. The American troops and ammunition
that were moved with a rush to the lines
of the Chateau-Thierry front were transported,
many of them, in the home grown
camions of the Mallet Reserve.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The trucks themselves, if you examine
them, tell many a story of transport under
shell-fire, tell of machine gunners borne to
the very rim of the battle so that gunners
need only drop from the camion, run down a
field and start firing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>When this book went to press, Mr. Day was
still in service, with the American Army of
Occupation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Today the war ended!—at least, one of
the buck privates read it so. He got hold of
a French newspaper, and caused some excitement
until one of the boys, who could read
the Lingo, commandeered the sheet. At any
rate, the Huns are beginning to squeal. Just
wait until a few Boche villages begin to get
theirs, and peace notes will begin to come
over....</p>

<p class='c007'>Well! I arrived back in camp again after
some jumping about France. We got away
from Aix without any trouble, but from
then on we began to wonder if we would get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>back into camp for Christmas. The trains
over here hate to get anywhere.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was night when we arrived in Paris,
late as usual, and so dark we had to hang
on to each other to keep from getting lost.
Having been there before, I was elected
guide, and I got the gang to the Provost
Marshal O. K., where we got our passes
stamped, and then I left them for the University
Union. Coming back from permission,
I was not loaded down with money,
but did have enough to see me through one
night. The Union was crowded, but I found
a place at a nearby hotel—a dandy room
on the ground floor, which rather surprised
me. During the bombing season, ground
floor rooms are the first to be taken.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>The next afternoon I went, with a lieutenant
I had met at the Union, to take a
look at Napoleon’s tomb. We walked over—the
lieutenant’s pocketbook must have
been as flat as mine. I will never regret
going, and I shall never forget the thrill I
got when standing in the doorway of the
chapel and seeing that golden light flooding
the cross.</p>

<p class='c007'>That golden light, that living cross, and
the pale blue-gray rays falling from the
side windows, made me feel miles from any
one.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tomb itself was covered with sandbags.
I remember going to the tomb when
I was here with you, before the war; but how
I could have forgotten that inspiring sight
is beyond me.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was no more time for sightseeing,
as I could not take a chance on missing
my train.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>Since my return I have heard the news
that our company clerk is leaving, and that
I am to take on his job as well as have charge

<p class='c007'>Today has been another rumor day. Those
coming back from convois sure have one hot
line from the front. “William the Hun” has
agreed, and the Boche have stacked arms and
are doing the goose-step back to Germany.
Would that it were true! Still, the way the
Huns are going now, they haven’t time to
goose-step, it’s more of a fox-trot.</p>

<p class='c007'>I’m enclosing one ticket good for a visit
from Santa Claus. Tell him to pack the
cigarettes and gum with care. Don’t chase
around to get stuff to fill the box—just pack
it full of cigarettes and send it along. Don’t
put in a Christmas card, it takes up room.</p>

<p class='c007'>Once upon a time I went to church and they
sang a song about “Rest, rest, for the weary.”
When I get home, I’m going to climb into bed
and let them sing me to sleep with that song.
Weary! Sleep! I could make a hibernating
bear look as though it had insomnia.</p>

<p class='c007'>Did I ever write a letter in which I didn’t
say “We have moved.” If so it must have
been when little apples were made. We have
moved! The way the Huns are going backwards,
my next letter should be headed
“Somewhere in Germany.” This move has
been one for the better in regard to quarters.
The Germans didn’t do much hating in this
village. No doubt they didn’t have time.
At any rate the houses are standing on their
own feet and the roofs are pretty much all
together.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have just finished up with the “Flu.”
Believe me, eight days with it is enough for
me and I don’t want to see it again. Feel
about as useful as a pair of pajamas in the
army. The Flu hit me when I wasn’t looking
and got me down before I knew what
struck me. They took me over to the camp
infirmary and put me to bed. When you are
once in bed you have no desire to leave. If
you do get up you find that your legs are no
longer mates, and refuse to work together.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>Just now I’m back in my old room wondering
what it has all been about. I slept most
of the time at the infirmary and had some
fine dreams. Pushing logs about and driving
over cliffs in camions were my favorites.
Once in a while I would dream that I was at
home again, but every time I was to see you
they would make me crank up my camion and
go somewhere else. I hope some day I’ll be
able to dream without having a camion enter
into it. I still don’t feel much like sitting
down to any kind of a meal. The first shave
I had since I was taken was yesterday. It
nearly killed me, and I left my moustache on
until my arm gets a little stronger. The
camp is shy a barber or I would have let
someone else do the job. If we don’t get a
barber soon I’m going to start braiding my
hair....</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>Over here nothing is ever stolen, swiped or
pinched. It is always “Système D.” As I
understand it there are three right ways of
getting things in the French army. Either
by Système A, B, or C. If you can’t get
what you want through these three channels,
you “Système D” it. All sorts of things
from coal to pianos have been obtained
through this “let not your left hand see what
your right is doing” method. Some one said
that by the end of the war we would all be
first class crooks. There may be more truth
than poetry in that. At any rate it’s a safe
bet that we won’t starve to death while the
war is going on. You would think that “Gott
Mit Uns” was made in the United States instead
of Germany, if you were to look at the
belts. I thought, until I went on permission,
that only the boys in the Reserve Mallet
wore the Hun belt. As far as I’ve seen practically
every “Yank” has and wears one of
these belts. Fully as many pants in the
United States Army in France are held up
by “Gott Mit Uns” as are held up by the
regulation belt.</p>

<p class='c007'>Isn’t the news wonderful! One of the boys
drifted in with a French newspaper and translated
the armistice terms laid down to Austria.
The Allies certainly left out the silver platter
when they handed them over. Wouldn’t I
like to be there when the Hun comes running
out with the white flag to call on General
Foch. We are all saying, “When we move

case like the fellow who said, “Why learn
French when we will be talking German in
Berlin soon.” Only it will be Vienna if we
should roll to Austria. Just think of their
being eighty minutes from Berlin by air.
Soon the aviation report will be, “So many
tons of bombs dropped on ‘Unter den Linden.’”
Won’t the Huns yell!</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>One of the boys that has come in since I
started this letter has just gone out to get a
bottle of wine so that we can celebrate the
glorious reports. If we start in celebrating
all such news, it will be—“Vin tous les
jours.” Italy showed that she had a punch
in each hand. Sad news from the front—“No
wine.” Some one else must have decided
to celebrate....</p>

<p class='c007'>All the talk these days is, “When I get
home.” I’ve heard what every man is going
to eat, wear, and do, when he gets to the
other side. Each one has his own taste in
regard to food. In the clothing line, anything
but a uniform is popular. As for doing—I
am afraid the wheels of progress are not going
to move very fast. All the boys are going to
just sit or sleep.</p>

to the conclusion that I can do as good a job
myself. Over here a bald headed man has the
advantage. Nothing doing with the clippers,
however, once was enough for me with a convict
head....</p>

<p class='c007'>The latest in regard to what becomes of us
after peace is declared, is that we will be with
the Army of Occupation. That doesn’t sound
at all good. It is a good thing that hearing

<p class='c007'>The night before last there was wild excitement
in camp. All afternoon we had been
hearing the latest news from the front, and
the war was finished at least every five
minutes. That night one of the boys returned
from the mission and said that a
Lieutenant told him that there was no doubt
about it, Germany had thrown up the sponge.
I wasn’t there, being asleep in bed at the time,
but they woke me up and told me between—hics—that
the war was over. The piano in
one company’s house was playing all the war
music that was ever written and the air rang
with cheers, popping of corks, songs, and
whatnot. It wasn’t long before our door was
banged open. We were paged and told that
the war was <i>fini</i>, and to come out and join
the party. I’m afraid they didn’t get much
of a response from us, both of us being pretty
tired. Some day they won’t be crying wolf
and we are going to miss out on the party.
The Frenchmen are just about crazy, and
who can blame them? When the end comes,
and it’s coming sooner than any of us realize,
you in the States will get the all over feeling
long before we do. Things will go on for us
camion drivers just about as they are going
now, and not until both feet are planted on
the other side of the pond will the <i>guerre</i> be
really finished for us.</p>

<p class='c007'>Am I awake or is it a dream. It doesn’t
seem possible that the war is OVER. When
it was brought home to me that the armistice
had been signed, it left me not dancing with
joy but numb. It didn’t seem possible and
now, two hours after, I’m just beginning to
cheer. Think of the millions that are made
happy these days, and think of those whose
boys will never return. Just about two
weeks ago the lieutenant I had in C Co. was
killed. He was a fraternity brother of mine,
and one of the finest fellows I have ever had
the pleasure of knowing. I am glad that I
have had the privilege of being one in the
great Army of Right. My only regret is that
I could not have come over about three years
sooner.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>I remember when I first got here, early in
July, 1917, how we looked forward to the day
when America would have its army in the
field. There was no question in our minds
about their showing something. When they
did get in they showed something all right,
they showed more than something. It was
a case of “The best is none too good.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We have moved along twice since I last
wrote. To look at the signs in this place you
would think you were in Germany. German
names for streets and German signs everywhere.
This isn’t the first of that kind that
we have struck, but it was more so than
the others. We are in a huge farmhouse
that used to be for Hun officers only. Its
roof hasn’t a hole and we haven’t a broken
pane of glass in our windows. We have the
best room yet, and a fireplace that could
take a tree, roots and all. The Boche turned
a nearby farm into a bath house and it is a
wonder. Showers beaucoup and tiled bath
rooms with enameled tubs. They moved so
fast that there isn’t much damage done.
They did leave their trade mark though.
There is a chateau that looks perfectly O. K.
from the outside, but inside it is a total loss.
They planted a mine and wrecked it. Mines
are planted all over the road. Yesterday
afternoon two went off. The last blew our
windows open.</p>

that the armistice had been signed, you would
have thought we had all gone suddenly crazy.
It took some time, I’ll admit, for the good
news to sink in—but when it did—Oh
boy!</p>

<p class='c007'>We are now on the way towards Germany.
It is almost a certainty that we will travel
along with one of the French armies of occupation;
carrying Ravitaillement (grub for
man and beast) to them. Talk about moving,
ever since the last shell was fired, that’s
all we have been doing. You would think we
were a checker game. I can’t say we were
tickled to death at the “Army of Occupation”
news as we expected to be on our way towards
the States within a couple of months.</p>

much rather take the place of this letter and

it can’t be done.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is sad but true, but we are a part of one
of the French armies of occupation and are
now “Nach Berlin.” We are making the
grade by the instalment plan—stop here today
and move on tomorrow. Our job is
carrying “Ravitaillement,” and we are just

which is nothing at all. Guess they decided
I was wearing out too many chairs, and drawing
too many pictures for a “Soldat deuxième

old mess sergeant and I can see a battle royal
ahead of me when I begin to dish up the

<p class='c007'>In the town I sent my last letter from, the
son of the people whose house we had taken
over dropped in to look the place over. It
was the first time in four years that he had
seen his parents’ home. His mother, sixty-four,
and his father, sixty-eight, were carried
off by the Huns in February. They were expected
back almost any day and he wanted to
see what there was left. The house was in
perfect condition and there were a few sticks
of furniture about, but the Boche had taken
the meat and left nothing but the bone. His
parents were more fortunate than many,
having a home with a roof, but even then it’s
pretty tough for two old people to return to
their home and find it stripped of the things
they loved.</p>

<p class='c007'>As you know, I jumped from the minor
league (American Field Service) into the
major (U. S. Army) on October 1st, 1917.
After taking the leap we were sent to Soissons
(Aisne) which was to be our home for some
little time. Soissons was some town! The
Boche had been there before us, but had left
a great part of the city standing. With its
hotels, cafés, tea rooms, stores, and bath
house, we led the life of Riley.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>Our camp lay just on the edge of the city
on the bank of the Aisne river, and in the
camp I had my first lesson in ditch digging,
kitchen policing, drilling, rock breaking, and
a few other like things.</p>

<p class='c007'>Things went along pretty smooth for us
until March 21, when there came the grand
finale as far as Soissons was concerned. Up
to that date we had had a few air raids,
which would start the twins barking and us
running for abris. The twins were a pair
of “seventy-fives” in a field right behind
camp.</p>

<p class='c007'>On March 21 things began to pick up. All
the morning I had been hauling rock and more
rock, and along towards noon I was tired,
dirty, and didn’t much care if school kept or
not. I walked into our barracks and started
some water boiling to remove my rock hauling
makeup (as far as I know, that water is
still boiling). Was lying on my bunk when
the word came that we were to pack up our
stuff and be ready to move at any moment.
It was like a bolt out of a clear sky. “Be
ready to move,” and we thought we were
settled for the rest of the war!</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>It did not take long to roll up my blankets,
to dump my stuff into my barracks bag, and
to lug it all down to my truck. Started to
roll my blankets after I got them to the
camion, when there came a whistle, a bang,
and a shower of dirt, stones, and twigs. A
shell had landed on the other side of the river.
Before I had time to collect my thoughts
there came another whistle. This time I was
under the truck ahead of the bang,—more
dirt, rocks, and twigs. No wonder they
were moving camp! There was a bridge
dead ahead of me, about forty yards away.
These two shells had just missed the end
furthest from me, and I could see that if the
bridge was the attraction I didn’t want to
stick around. My blankets were still unrolled
and I started at them again. Another
whistle, another dive, and this time a regular
downpour. This shell had landed on my side
of the river just off the bridge. Right on its
heels came another, and this one saw my exit.
I started for camp on the run, but didn’t
get far before there came a bang. The concussion
floored me and when I picked myself
together, saw a bunch of the boys gathered
around something under a tree that had
been hit.</p>

our head. The boy who was wounded is now

landed in the river, side of the dining room.
It seemed as though they were following us.
Later on when we turned the trucks around
and ran them by camp away from the bridge,
the shells began to land up at that end. That
night, however, the Huns raised their guns
and began to send the shells over our heads
towards the railway station. All that night
we would hear the whistle of the shells passing
over head and the bang in the distance
of their landing.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next day we moved out of Soissons
onto the “Route de Paris.” We were just
outside the city and all night and most of the
day it was bang, bang, bang. The Huns
certainly were throwing the shells into the
city, and it didn’t make you feel “in the
pink,” when you had to go into it for water,
and to the storehouse and railway station for
supplies. All the time we were there it
was “beaucoup” work. We carried a great
many troops from one front to another and
miles of shells. In fact it was work from
then on.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>After a short stay here we carried on to
Villa Helon, which is about two kilometers
from Longpont. This town was a gem and
it certainly was tough when we had to leave.
The day we left, May 28, I believe, the town
roads were crowded with incoming and outgoing
troops.</p>

<p class='c007'>We moved at about midnight and the Huns
gave us a farewell in the shape of a bombing.
The French were setting up their famous
seventy-five guns in the rear of the chateau
as we pulled out. That wonderful chateau is
now, no doubt, a heap of ruins.</p>

<p class='c007'>Refugees were everywhere. Wagons loaded
with their goods, people on foot, in carts,
on bicycles, all moving towards Paris, crowded
the roads.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>From Villa Helon we pushed on to Barcy,
stopping over night a couple of times at some
towns. Barcy lies just outside the city of
Meaux and is right where France turned the
Germans back in 1914.</p>

<p class='c007'>While in this town we carried shell after
shell to those points where the heaviest fighting
was going on. It was at Chateau-Thierry
that we first saw the American troops
in number.</p>

<p class='c007'>What a changed Chateau-Thierry it was
when the Boche were driven out! It wasn’t
as badly shot up as I expected to find it, but
it certainly had been mauled.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>From Barcy we moved to Hardivillers.
This small town lies between Breteuil and
Crèvecœur-le-Grand, not far from Amiens.
In the latter place and beyond, we saw
our first of the British. It was in and
around Amiens that bombs were the thickest.
The country was so open that a night
convoi was always an invitation for a bomb.
Between Moreuil and Hangest they took
twelve shots at us without a hit. That same
night, however, they got another section
and wounded a couple of men and killed
another.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our next stop was Bus, the town of no roofs
and German dugouts, with the nearby woods
that sported the German huts. Bus is between
Montdidier and Roye. The former
city is the worst shot up of any that I have
seen. It lies on the top of a hill and is just
blown to dust. Not a wall or a tree standing.
One could live in Roye without a great deal
of rebuilding, but there are only walls left.
Ham wasn’t shot up, but burned. While at
Bus my permission came through and I left
the bunch not knowing where I would find
them when I came back.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>Port-à-Binson was where I found them.
No doubt you read how the Germans tried
to get into Épernay on account of its being a
centre for supplies. Port-à-Binson is not far
from Épernay, lying on the bank of the river
Marne. Here it was I took up the duties of
clerk—something I’ll always remember.</p>

<p class='c007'>When we moved again it was to Jonchery,
between Fismes and Rheims. While in the
Field Service I had often gone through
Fismes; you wouldn’t know it now, ruins is
no name for it. From there we rolled on to
Malmaison. Here we got the news that the
armistice had been signed. Since leaving
that town, we have stopped over night in a
few other villages until we struck here.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>This account is more or less a bunch of
names. I haven’t said much about the work,
which has been carrying shells most of the
time. Nor have I given much dope on some
of the excitement that we have seen. Believe
me, we have had a little excitement in the
way of bombs, and once in a while, shells.</p>

<p class='c007'>I wrote about the Boche and their camouflaged
plans. That took place at Chézy aux
Orxois between Chateau-Thierry and Mareuil
sur Ourcq. On that day we were carrying
shells and my car being the last had the fusees.
You can see that underneath my car was no
place at all to use as an abris.</p>

<p class='c007'>I’m enclosing a bit of German propaganda,
some of the bunk that they used to drop from
planes. They certainly must have been in a
pipe dream if they expected any one to fall
for that stuff. Their minds work in a queer
way.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>One of the men who used to work in the
atelier when we had French workmen, came
in to see us the other day. He had just got
back from his permission and from seeing his
wife and son who had been prisoners. The
Huns had cut the forefinger from each of his
wife’s hands. That was mild compared with
some of the other things that they did.</p>

<p class='c007'>The other night we staged a party. The
result is my drawing of Monsieur Light Wine.
Never again.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rumors are flying about. The latest is
that all men will return to their original
companies. That’s all right, but what becomes
of the Field Service men? If it’s all
the same to those higher up, I’ll take home.</p>

<p class='c007'>Winter has at last taken the padlock off.
The rain that has been falling for the last few
days, has now turned to snow and the temperature
has moved from its suite half way
up to one near the ground floor. Rubber
boots and an over coat are very much in
style these days—also a red nose.</p>

<p class='c007'>We are now taking the count in the village
of Boulzicourt near the cities of Mézières
and Charleville. Sedan is also quite close by.
The day before yesterday I took a trip to
Charleville: object, a bath. Managed to
catch a ride on a truck going over.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>
<img src='images/i_079.jpg' alt='P-O-P<br><br> THIS IS THE WAY WE FEEL AT TIMES——' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>After the bath, met a couple of the boys
and we hustled around to get things fixed up
for supper. None of the cafés or restaurants
have started in to serve meals so we went into
the market and got some steak and potatoes.
The prices are sky high, but one has to eat.
These we took around to a small café and had
them cooked up. The steak was tough, but
the “cuisinier” had cooked it in a most
delicious way — with Pinard. The potatoes
as usual were French Fried. We had brought
along our own wine or we would have been
out of luck.</p>

<p class='c007'>After supper we drifted around to a dance
hall. It was crowded, about ten men to one
girl, so we didn’t try our luck at the French
dancing. All they do is whirl—always in
one way and they never reverse. Once in
awhile you see someone trying to do the old
turkey trot. After sticking around a short
while, we started home. No ride this time—no
luck at all, so we burnt up the road for the
ten kilom’s.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>Yesterday I was over to Sedan. It was
raining so hard that I didn’t do much chasing
around. Of the two cities Charleville is the
more picturesque with its long sloping roofs
and its quaint old fashioned French appearance.
Sedan looks more modern, more like
the States.</p>

<p class='c007'>The day we moved, five of us got left behind.
That is there wasn’t enough room in
the remaining camion—the others had pulled
out and we thought they were waiting somewhere
down the line. The first stop we knew
was to be at Boulzicourt, so we started out
on foot. All of us were dressed pretty
warmly, as we had expected to hold down the
front end of a camion. It was raining and
soon our overcoats were weighing close to a
ton. Up the line about three miles, I discovered
that two letters for one of the boys
had been forgotten in the shuffle. It was
up to me to go back and one of the boys said
he’d come along. Back we went and rescued
the mail. We got under way again and this
time had the luck to jump an ambulance that
was going straight through. It was going,
it didn’t even hit the high spots. About half
way we passed the other three birds riding
the back end of a truck. We pulled into
Boulzicourt and discovered that the camion
had moved on to a place called Flize, which
is on the way to Sedan.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>A camion came bowling along so we hopped
aboard. Of course it was going to the wrong
village, but we didn’t worry—one can always
catch a ride. At Mézières the truck pulled up
and we jumped off. It was still raining and
we weren’t what you would call dry. Hungry
and not a thing could be had in the way of
food. Nothing in the shops, but we did
manage to get coffee. Along towards night,
we ran into a Frenchman that set us up to
one fine supper with wine and rum. About
that time we decided we might as well be
setting out for the camp. It was raining
great guns and was so dark that we gave it
up as a bad job. Instead we got a room over
a café. The woman who ran the place came
over on the ark. She had remained during
the years that the Boche held the town, and,
as a consequence kept running in German
with her French—something that happens
quite frequently in these parts. Our room
was a wonder. The bed boasted seven mattresses;
reminded me of the fairy story of
how to tell a real princess—when a bunch of
Janes claimed the crown and to test them out
they put them to bed on a stack of mattresses.
Underneath was a pea. The fake ones slept
like a log, but she of the purple couldn’t sleep
at all and, in the morning, she was black and
blue from the lump raised by the pea. We
either are not of the purple or there was
nothing under the mattresses, for we certainly
tore off the sleep. Just before we turned in
there was an awful banging on Madame’s door,
and yells in French, German, and Sanscrit I
guess. She had locked herself in. We went
out and discovered the key sticking into the
lock of her door. We gave it a turn, but the
door stayed shut. We gave it a couple of
more turns, and tried other combinations—still
the door refused to open. In the meantime
the old girl was yelling “nicht’s” and
“ja’s” and French cuss words. We expected
the whole town to show up. Finally Bill had
the brilliant idea of seeing how our door
worked. We went over to try it out and in
fooling with it the door knob came out in my
hand. I went over, stuck it into Madame’s
door and “Voilà” the caged bird was free.
In the morning we set out for Flize.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>It was still raining and we didn’t get a ride.
We walked and walked and no sign of camp.
My coat was soaked through, my rubber
boots were raising the devil with my feet,
and my labors had given me a turkish bath.
We pulled into Flize, with nothing like a
camp in sight. While we were deciding
whether to wait around for a ride to Sedan,
where the Mission was, or to look for quarters,
one of our trucks came panting along. The
camp was at Boulzicourt. They had come
over near Flize, had stayed two hours, and
had gone to Boulzicourt. A staff car came
flying along, we got a ride and here we
are.</p>

<p class='c007'>This town is quite large. Our quarters
are very comfortable. We are billeted in a
French house. Four of us have a front room,
and if the sun ever comes out, we should get
our share of it. Our fireplace is working all
the time and we are kept busy getting wood
to keep the home fire burning.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>Madame had us in for coffee the other afternoon.
She was here while the Huns held the
town. Naturally she has no love for them.
What they couldn’t steal they took, and she’s
just about left high and dry. Her son was
captured at Verdun, but is now home.</p>

<p class='c007'>The town hasn’t come back to life yet.
When it does there are enough cafés to feed
and drink us all. Two dance halls with these
player pianos are open. Ten centimes sets
the music going. They have a total of nine
tunes among which is the Merry Widow—you
can see how up to date the music is. At
nights these places are crowded with the
French troops and Italian road workers. All
told I’ve seen three girls, all at once, in these
places.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>Yesterday my Christmas box showed up.
The cigarettes came at the right moment, as
for three days I’d been using a corn cob.
The “Y” had run out of smokes, and they
hardly ever visit us nowadays. The knife
was a wonder—too good to use.</p>

<p class='c007'>The other day some of our trucks hauled
champagne. They came through here and
stopped for supper, and then went on. They
left a few cases behind, so water isn’t very
popular just now.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a chance of our getting back inside
of a year—just a chance. Hate to
think of another winter over here. Guess by
the time I get back there won’t be anything
going on in the states, the war will be a dead
issue then.</p>

didn’t come across with any extras, but by
scouring the country for miles around our
company, and all the companies for that
matter, had some meal served up. Here’s
our line up—celery soup, roast beef, mashed
potatoes, macaroni with cheese and tomatoes,
a salad, cake, prune pie, celery, and cocoa.
Besides the Red Cross sent cigarettes, candy,
and crackers.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>In the afternoon we took a ride by camion
to Sedan where the “Y” was putting on some
kind of a show for us. After much cheering,
and not missing a single bump we arrived
and found that the show was going on—movies
were being run off—French movies,
a nice long drawn out thing in six or seven
parts on Nero, his love affairs, his fiddle, and
Rome. I for one wasn’t at all mad when they
cut the picture short and started in on some
live stuff. After a Lieutenant got a couple
of stories off his chest, the ball started. Some
real American coons from a near by outfit
were the live stuff. They sang by fours,
threes, and twos, and when they got tired of
that they gave us some A No. 1 clog dancing.
Believe me! they could sure shuffle their feet.
The “Y” had decked them out in some paper
caps which added to the hilarity. They were
the whole show and it was worth the trip to
see them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The “Y” also were there with the Christmas
tree. We rang the bell for chocolate,
cigarettes, a cigar, and cookies.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>The other day I went over to Charleville
again. Ran into a place that had real pies—chocolate
and apple. Also had cakes. The
prices were near the top, but we bought a
few notwithstanding. The girl behind the
counter could have sold us ice at the North
Pole—she was a peach. Two of us told the
boys to break away and we would show them
something better—and we did. There was
a girl in a small café that we had discovered
on our last trip. We took the boys along in
and they agreed that she was <i>the</i> class. Here
we ate the pies and cakes and the girl behind
the bar came in for a share. It was a good
thing that we were riding in the Ford and not
walking, or we would never have got back to
camp. Those pies went fine but we ate more
than our share I’m afraid.</p>

<p class='c007'>Last night and today it snowed again—just
enough for snow balls. This afternoon
we were throwing them with the French kids.
They can peg them as well as our boys, but
I guess they forget how to use their wing
when they get older.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>There are two kids that drop into the office
three times a day for their cigarette allowance.
The oldest is sixteen and the youngest thirteen.
I made the mistake of giving them one the
first day and they now take it as a matter of
course. Guess I’ll start them to work sweeping
out the place on their next visit. That
may break them of the habit—like offering
a tramp work when he asks for food.</p>

<p class='c007'>I don’t know if it will work, however, as
there are a couple who hang out at our

the odd jobs. They are a great help to the
K. P.’s—in fact our kitchen police, since
these kids came along, live the life of Riley
and as for the kids, they eat to their hearts’
content.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>Saw Les. Herrick yesterday. He’s looking
fine. We went over the feed we had last
Christmas night—it was a wonder. One of
the boys reminded me that last Christmas
eve we were pulled out of bed eleven times
on account of air raids. The Boche did their
best to put one over on us, but we fooled them.
I’ll never forget those raids. First you would
hear the guns barking in the distance. Then
the bark would get nearer and nearer. Next
the twins would let out their war cry. Finally
the Lieut. would stick his head in the door
with the words, “I want every man to go to
the abri at once.” Then would be the hunt
in the dark for shoes, tin derby, gas mask,
and coat. Then a few bombs. Then the
dash for the abri. Then the standing around
wondering how long it was going to last.
Then another bark from the twins. Then a
few more bombs. Then the dying away buzz
of the planes. Then the grand return, only
to do it all over again a few minutes later.
It was a great life. The Field Service sent
a wallet to us for a Christmas present. On
the inside there is printed in gold letters
“Dernier Noël de la Guerre en France.”
Translated literally that means, “It is more
blessed to give than to receive.” Understand
that they were also going to give us some kind
of a medal but they weren’t finished in time
and that later on they will come through.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>So another Christmas came and another

same to all those concerned I’ll take my next

<p class='c007'>We have slid into the New Year almost
without knowing it. We did, however, have
a small celebration New Year’s Eve; but as
there was no ringing of bells or tooting of
horns at midnight, we had nothing to remind
us just what this party was all about.</p>

<p class='c007'>The night before last the French troops in
town put on a show. Stage, scenery, and
orchestra were very much there, even a
spotlight. The acts were mostly singing ones;
sad songs, glad songs, and every old kind of
a song were dished up. There were also a
couple of monologues thrown in for good luck.
They talked so fast that I wasn’t able to get
what they were all about, but from the laughs
and cheers they must have been not only
good but spicy. To wind things up, there
was a one-act play. There were two women
parts, both taken by French soldiers. They
were right there with the looks and form
divine. I was able to follow the play and
as they say at home, it was rather broad.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>Today was qualification card day. An
officer sits at a table with a card, that has
more questions on it than a questionnaire
and shoots question after question at you.
You are asked everything, from who your
favorite actress is to how old is Ann. One
question was, “What branch of the service
would you choose, if you had to do it all
over again?” Guess everyone answered that
question the same: “Anything but this.”
After all was said and done, it was still a
question of when we would get home.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>Went over to Charleville the other day.
Same old reason—to get a bath. The bath
house was closed, however, there being no
water. Going over you came pretty close
to collecting on my insurance. We got a
ride on a truck, the driver of which would be
a wonder as a tank jockey. After missing a
few pedestrians, he ended up by trying to do
a Brodie off a bridge. Some German prisoners
were ahead of us on the bridge, pushing
a field range along. There was a space left
about big enough for a baby carriage to squeeze
by, and “dauntless Harry,” seeing an opening,
tried to see if his truck would fit said
opening. It didn’t, and the first thing we
knew the camion had crashed through the
railing and the front wheels were dangling in
space. The drop wasn’t a great distance,
but if we had taken the fall no doubt we would
have been found with the camion resting on
the back of our necks.</p>

<p class='c007'>This week has been full of ’most everything
from M. P’s. to Colonels.</p>

<p class='c007'>Today the Inspector-General gave us the
once over, only he isn’t a General, just a
Colonel. You never saw such a scrubbing,
brushing, and general cleaning up, as went
on. Our quarters looked like a livery stable
when we started in, but at the finish the
Board of Health would have presented us
with a blue ribbon. Clothes were folded up
and placed on bunks, shoes shined to a white
heat, faces washed and shaved, nails cleaned,
and guns dusted off. At two o’clock the curtain
went up. Down to the field we marched
where we were to be looked over and to look
over. We were all curious to see just what
kind of an army bird an Inspector-General
was. Judging from majors and colonels we
had seen, we expected someone who would
scare us out of seven years of life when he
asked a question. However, this colonel
was O. K. and for once an inspection was almost
a pleasure. After being given the up
and down we marched back to camp where
we fell out to stand by our beds for a barracks
inspection. We stood by our beds, on which
were laid out all our A. E. F. possessions.
Being in the company office, and being company
clerk, I expected to have all sorts of
questions fired at me in regard to service
records, reports, and all that goes to make the
life of a clerk anything but a joy. However,
I didn’t have to open my mouth.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>The inspector said that the French had
spoken very highly of us and our work. In
fact the French M. T. C. have said that
their American Groupes have done more
work, rolled more cars, and kept their camions
in better conditions than any French section.
That if the French had had the camions that
we did, the cars would have been in the junk
pile long ago.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our Groupe commander received the Croix
de Guerre last Sunday. He says it’s for the
work done by his men at the front when they
hauled tanks. It was at the time when
Lieutenant Edwards was killed.</p>

<p class='c007'>I’ve been to Luxembourg. Our Lieutenant
gave us his permission and Ford to make the
trip. Last Saturday at noon we started out.
We got to Luxembourg at seven and three of
us went into a hotel to get rooms and see
about supper. The other two went out on
a hunt for a garage. We got the rooms (you
never saw such beds), arranged for supper,
and then went out to the corner to wait for
the return of the jitney jockeys. We had no
sooner started waiting than two M. P.’s
(military police) gave us the glad hand.
Wanted to know what we were doing and if
we had passes.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>We told them we were waiting for two boys
who had gone to stable a flivver and that
our pass was with them. That didn’t seem
to please the M. P.’s. (They are always
hard to please.) They wanted to know just
what our business in Luxembourg was and
just what kind of a pass we had. We told
them we were in Luxembourg for pleasure
only, and that our pass was a red auto pass
signed by Major Mallet and countersigned
by our Lieutenant. That answer didn’t make
the M. P.’s feel any more friendly. Instead
they told us in no polite terms to come with
them. We went!</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>The three of us were marched to the city
hall where our names, number, and A. E. F.
address was taken, everything but finger
prints. The room where this third degree
took place was no doubt the club room of the
Luxembourg police, as three or four of them
were scattered about the scenery. (Their
uniform is good enough for any general, if
brass buttons count.) After getting our pedigree,
an M. P. picked up a very businesslike
looking key and invited us to come with him.
We went. We were taken to a six by four
cell which was already inhabited by two other
law breakers. Just about this time we woke
up to the fact that we were arrested and questions
came thick and fast. The questions
didn’t get us anywhere, so we asked to see
an A. P. M. officer. There wasn’t any but
at twelve o’clock we could see the sergeant
of the guard in another jail. Good night!
One hundred and fifty kilometers—to be
pinched!</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>All the time we were wondering what had
become of the other two. In about an hour
we heard the door out front open and then
heard voices in the club room. It was they!
The pass was no good, to be good it needed
only a General’s scrawl. The gate opened
and in they came.</p>

<p class='c007'>At twelve o’clock we were pulled out and
lined up with the rest of that night’s haul.
About twenty of us, I should say. We were
then marched to the other side of the river
to the railroad station. Through the waiting
room and upstairs we were taken. A very
heavy door was opened and we were pushed
into a room. In this room were gathered the
round-up from all the smaller jails. There
were about fifty of us, and the room was
overflowing. No chairs, bunks or pictures,
just a dirty floor and a blank wall. The
gathering was a rummage sale.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>About six o’clock the corporal of the guard
came in. He looked the room over and asked
where the five men were who had the French
pass. We spoke up and were told to come
with him. We went and were told that our
pass was no good, that we could go but would
have to leave town at once.</p>

<p class='c007'>Luxembourg, from what I saw of it, is a
wonderful city. Street cars, electric lights,
cafés, hotels, stores and at least one good-looking
girl, were a few of the things we saw.</p>

<p class='c007'>No doubt you have noticed that each division
has some sort of shoulder insignia.
Ours is a yellow trumpet on a green background.
It is the coat of arms of the Mallet
Reserve. If ever you see on the left sleeve
right where it joins the shoulder the yellow
trumpet on the green background, you will
know that the Mallet Reserve is on its way.</p>
